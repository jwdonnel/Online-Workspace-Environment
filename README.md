# OpenWSE
<b>Introduction</b>
<br />
The OpenWSE is a Windows desktop like workspace. The goal of this site is to provide a Windows like experience but from your web browser on any computer. Much like your desktop, you can have multiple modal windows (called apps) opened on your workspace. And just like your desktop, if you have apps opened that you dont want to close, but dont want to show, you can simply minimize them in the taskbar at the top. Apps can be based off of UserControls (.ascx), existing webpages, or just custom html pages. Apps can incorporate their own css stylesheets along with javascript files and other code. This allows for any developer to integrate with the OpenWSE code. Each user can register an account (if enabled by the Administrator) that allows you to save your apps position, size, and whats loaded so you can go from any browser or computer and keep the same settings.

Overlays that are like apps but are more stationary and are only available with certain apps.<br />
Install/Remove any app as you please. If available, the App Installer can allow you to install new apps and/or plugins.<br />
Database Integration and Custom Table builder - If you have another database you want to integrate with, you can use the simple Database Importer tool under the site settings. Furthermore, you can also create your own custom tables that are stored in the sites database. Imports and Custom tables create their own apps for you to interact with.<br />
Custom just about anything on your workspace from the background to the taskbar. Make your workspace different from everyone else.<br />
